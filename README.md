# Week-1-Challenge-Refactoring

## Purpose of this challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to become familiar with using semantic HTML tags. These tags help screen readers, and
make the webpage more accessible. This challenge also helped reinforce good commit habits, along with commenting practices, and CSS style rule compiling. It was a good lesson on making pre-existing code better and cleaner.
